# Movie Data Analysis

## Introduction

This is an exploratory dive into the data sets as well as a recommendation of actionable information for the purposes of movie media creation and the launching of a movie studio owned by Microsoft. 

## Business Goal

The goal of this project is to provide meaningful information from the data analysis of the provided data sets. The information I will in turn be providing will allow those whom it concern a clear and concise direction in which way to take their first steps into movie media production.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.
Your team is charged with exploring what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

These data sets were provided to me a part of the project by the Flatiron School

* put info about new_imdb later *

## Analysis

There were 3 major questions that required answers for moving forward on something actionable.

## 1.) What movie's made the most profit? Are there any traits in common with those?

A: The data would suggest that the movies that see the most box office success, both as
one of the most common and as one of the highest earners, is 'Action, animation, & Comedy'.

Drama is the most common movie type.

Action, Adventure, & Sci-Fi is the single highest earner genre combination.

## 2.) What movies have the highest Rating?

The data shows that purely drama movies have the highest ratings as well as being the most common genre type.

The second most common genre is Comedy & Drama in combination.

## What is the relation between the findings of Box Office Gross vs. Critical Reviews and Ratings?

The data shows that Comedy seems to be the middle ground between high earning in box office sales and high ratings. Comedy didn't show to be the highest rated, the most common, or the best selling genre type. However, the data did show that in all instances there was some element of comedy just bellow the top spot. People sincerely like a good laugh and the data shows they will seek it out often and pay well for it.

## Recommendations

As a new studio, it's important to build a reputation and become well known enough to be trusted for likeable content. 'Drama' and  'Drama, Comedy' are safe and provide enough contract between one another to build a reputation for movies that are well liked. This is where Microsoft should start their content creation.

As a transitional movie into higher earning genres movie with a 'Action, Adventure, Comedy' genre combination will both hit on the Comedy you've established yourself for as well as intro duce a new kind of genre to your repetoire

Finally, moving into a movie combining 'Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi' will place Microsoft solidly into higher earning. Fall back to Drama and comedy for damage control with high rating on these genres of movies will solidify your place as a major player in movie media creation.

## Conclusion 

The information i've provided is a rough outline of you short term plan to establish Microsoft as a new source of media entertainment for the masses. And as Microsoft already possesses a firm grasp on the production and selling of Windows Computers, you will have no trouble establish footing in an environment for streaming content in a similar that the likes of Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ currently do.
